-----The following steps set up the initial conditions for an impact.-----

1. Open a terminal in this folder. 
   A shortcut is to right click and choose "Open in Terminal".
   
2. Open the setupImpactInitialization file and set the parameters for the impact.
   Note, this just sets the initial positions and velocities of the two bodies to be impacted.
   Don't forget to save the file.

3. Next you will generate an initial impact (ie, time = 0) with the specified positions and velocities.
   To do this, type this in the terminal:
   
   ./runImpactInitialization

   This will then create a time stamped folder in the ImpactBin folder which contains 1 folder and 4 files. 
   (Note the time stamp only goes down to the minute so	if you make more than one in a minute the program will 
   throw an error.).
   If you would like, you can change the name of this folder to something more descriptive.	
	
4. Go into your new folder and follow the instructions outlined in the addTimeAndViewerReadMe file. 



-----The following is just information about the two folders in the current directory-----

- The ImpactBin folder contains all impacts created for this set up of bodies.

- The TargetImpactorInformation folder contains 4 files:

  	The setupGeneratingTargetImpactor file is just a copy of the setup file in the Giant-Impact folder 
  	that created this set of bodies.
  
  	The targetImpactorInitialPosVel file (a binary file) contains the positions and velocities of the 
  	two bodies.
  
  	The targetImpactorParameters file contains unit conversion and other pertinent information about 
  	the two bodies.

  	The targetImpactorStats file contains general stats about the two bodies created.
