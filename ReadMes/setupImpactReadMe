1. Open a terminal in this folder. (right click in this window and it should be one of the options)
2. Open the setupImpactInitialization file and set the parameters for the impact. (Save the file)
4. type ./runImpactInitialization in the terminal. This will place the target and impactor at the 
	specified locations and give them specified velocities. It will then create a time stamped folder 
	in the ImpactBin folder and place them there. (Note the time stamp only goes down to the minute so 
	if you make more than one in a minute the program will complain.) 
5. Go into your new folder to add time to your impact and to view your impact. 
	Initially you just have an impact at time equal to zero (One still frame of time, positions, and vilocities)
