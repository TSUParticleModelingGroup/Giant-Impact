-----The following steps are for adding time to an impact or viewing an impact.-----

1. Open a terminal in this folder. 
   A shortcut is to right click and choose "Open in Terminal".

2. Open the setupImpactAddTime file and set the time to add to the impact. You can also modify
   parameters to change the time step, draw rate, and record rate. Don't forget to save the file.

3. To actually add time to the impact, in the terminal, type 

	./runImpactAddTime
	
   Note, this will add additional time to the impact starting from where it left off.

4. At any time, to view the entire impact, in the terminal, type

	./runImpactViewer
	
   Note, the viewer does no n-body calculations. It simply reads the impactPosVel file and displays
   frames to the screen.



-----The following is just information about the impactInformation folder and runStatsFile file-----

- The runStatsFile file contains stats about the impact up to the current time. It is updated every time
  runImpactAddTime is called.

- The impactInformation folder contains 3 files:

  	The impactPosVel file (a binary file) contains the positions and velocities of all elements in the impact.
  	
  	The initialStatsFile file contains the initial (ie. time = 0) stats of the impact. 
  	
  	The setupImpactInitialization file contains a copy of the setup file that set up the initial conditions of
  	the impact.
