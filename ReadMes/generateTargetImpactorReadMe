-----The following steps set up the Target and Impactor bodies.-----

1. Open a terminal in this folder (Giant-Impact). 
   A shortcut is to right click and choose "Open in Terminal".

2. To compile all the code and place it in the correct locations, in the terminal, type:

        ./compileAll 
   
   (Note this only needs to be done once unless you modify the source code.)

3. Now, you should open the setupGeneratingTargetImpactor file and set the parameters for your run. 
   These parameters will set the parameters for the two bodies that will be created.
   Once you are happy with your setup parameters, save the file.

4. Next, you will generate the Target and Impactor with the parameters you set in the 
   setupGeneratingTargetImpactor file. First, the bodies will be created and allowed to settle into place.
   Then, the bodies will be spun, and again, allowed to settle. At this point, the bodies are completely
   independent and have no influence on one another. Once this process has been completed, the Target and 
   Impactor will be put in a time stamped folder in the TargetImpactorBin. 
   (Note the time stamp only goes down to the minute so if you make more than one
   in a minute the program will throw an error.) To generate the bodies, in the terminal type:
	
	./runGTI
	
   You should note the date/time so you can identify the bodies you just created.

5. Open the TargetImpactorBin folder, and you will find the generated folder containing the two bodies.
   If you would like, you can rename this folder to a more descriptive name. Go into this folder. In this
   folder you will find two folders and three files, containing all the information you will need to create
   impacts using the two bodies you created.
   
6. Now for instructions on how to generate an impact using the two bodies you just created, follow the
   instructions provided in the setupImpactReadMe file.
