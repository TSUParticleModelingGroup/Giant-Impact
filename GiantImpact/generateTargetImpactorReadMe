1. Open a terminal in this folder. (right click in this window and it should be one of the options)
2. type ./compileAll in the terminal. This will compile all the code and put it in the correct locations.
	(Note this only needs to be done once unless you got in the source code and changed something.)
3. Open the setupGeneratingTargetImpactor file and set the parameters for the run. (Save the file)
4. type ./runGTI in the terminal. This will generate a Target and Impact with the specification you 
	set up in the setupGeneratingTargetImpactor file. These will be put in a time stamped folder in the 
	TargetImpactorBin. (Note the time stamp only goes down to the minute so if you make more than one
	in a minute the program will complain.) 
5. Go into your new folder to set up an impact.
