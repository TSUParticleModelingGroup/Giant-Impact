* Additional time to add to impact in days.
AdditionTime = 10.0;

* Time step.
Dt = 0.002;

* This is how many time steps pass before the current impact is updated (graphically) on the screen.
* The smaller the value, the more often you will record to the screen.
DrawRate = 100;

* This the number of time steps that passes between successive recordings of positions and velocities
* to the impactPosVel file, which is used to view and analyze impacts.
* The smaller the value, the more frames you will be storing.
RecordRate = 100;

* Roundoff will cause the center of mass and the linear velocity of the system to drift.
* This makes it hard to keep the view centered on what you are enterested in.
* Hence we reset the center of mass and the linear velocity of the system to its initial 
* value after every "RecenterRate" number of interations. This is time consuming but it will 
* allow you to perform long runs and record movies without the need to constantly track 
* the body you are enterested in.
RecenterRate = 1000;


**Note**
* DrawRate only affects graphical outputs of active impact generation.
* RecordRate affects writing to the disk.
