* Additional time to add to impact in days.
AdditionTime = 10.0;

* Time step.
Dt = 0.002;

* This is how many time steps pass before the current impact is updated (graphically) on the screen.
* The smaller the value, the more often you will record to the screen.
DrawRate = 100;

* This the number of time steps that passes between successive recordings of positions and velocities
* to the impactPosVel file, which is used to view and analyze impacts.
* The smaller the value, the more frames you will be storing.
RecordRate = 100;


**Note**
* DrawRate only affects graphical outputs of active impact generation.
* RecordRate affects writing to the disk.
